#### Astrology theory unedited notes draft 1
###### Theory 1: Constellations have nothing to do with anything.
-  In history, they were ways to "write" stories before we had written texts so that lessons could perpetuate through generations, but are entirely arbitrarily coincidental
- Associations to Signs were entirely arbitrarily coincidental
    - This is not to say that the themes and traits associated with Signs are invalid, simply their names are _Only borrowed_ from constellations and nothing more
    - The zodiacal constellations are all divisions of the sky in the "orbit" of the Sun, in which the Sun spends roughly 30 days
       - *"Ancient astronomers noticed that the Sun, Moon and five visible planets regularly wander through a very specific path in the sky. Because the planets never deviate from this path, which we call the ecliptic, there are certain constellations on that path that the planets repeatedly walk through. This is how the constellational zodiac was first developed. It included every constellation that the planets actually moved through, and it excluded constellations that they didn’t move through."* <sup>(1)</sup> 
        - This gives us the idea to divide the Ecliptic plane into 12 equal parts associated with a Sign; at the time of conception, the constellations were in each sign, despite the fact that the constellations vary in size. This described the Sidereal zodiac.
        - *"Around this time the seasons were roughly aligned with the Sidereal zodiac, so that the beginning of the seasons coincided with the beginning of the cardinal signs — Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn. The middle of the seasons coincided with the fixed signs — Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius. The end of the seasons coincided with the mutable signs — Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces."*<sup>(1)</sup>
    - Due to Precession, the point where the Celestial equinox and the Ecliptic Plane intersects (the vernal equinox and beginning of the tropical zodiac)  moved position, over time, into a different Constellation.
        - This caused an issue of whether the Ecliptic divisions should also move and continue to be measureed against the position of the constellations and adjust calculations for precession (the Sidereal house system), 
        - __or__ if the the divisions should stay the where they are and be measured against the seasons, and recognize that the Constellations are not the same of the Sign. "This is the basis of what is referred to as the Tropical zodiac, which is measured relative to the seasons, with its starting point at the vernal equinox."<sup>(1)</sup>
    - The latter is, in Western Culture, the accepted and most commonly used. While both have have "issues", I will focus on the Tropical
        - The first being that, despite making a distinction between "Constellations" and "Signs", signs are still associated with constellations. 
            - e.g., we think of Someone with planets in Taurus as being bull-headed, like the constellation that is the Bull. 
            - But, the association of the constellation to the sign of the zodiac was essentially accidental, therefore, is the association of the Constellations Aries and "the Ram" accidental, or is the the Ram accidentally associated with the Sign? Clearly, they cannot be both
            - The Tropical zodiac focuses more on seasons and literally ignores the position of the constellations. So should the Signs not be more closely associated with seasonal cycles than to the constellations which take over 2000 years to move across the ecleptic as we have it defined?
                - There is certainly a cycle to the position of the constellations relative to the Vernal Equinox; this cycle is lterally thousands of years, and the objects that define the constellations are unthinkably far away.
                - This is accepted by most Astrologers without questions, However
                - Despite ignoring the constellations, we immortalized the imagery of the constellations into the Signs, giving the impression that there is still a belief that the meanings of the Signs came from the constellations, even if the constellations are not in the Signs, and won't be again for a very long time.
                - Again, this is not to assume that the meanings associated with the Signs are accidental; The argument is that "source" of the meanings is not the constellations, but some "where" that more closely resembles the cycle of the Signs that we have deliberately chosen to measure against the seasons. 
                - The constellations are loaded with myths and legends from multiple cultures across centuries - if the Signs do not actually derive their meaning from the constellations, is there not risk that we load the Signs with irrelevant material?
    - This should not imply that constellations have no purpose in Astrology, as they are often used in Astronomy as "land marks" to where an object is in the sky; in a map of the sky, the constellations (not just the 12 of the zodiac) are territories, boundaries and markers that can be used to refernce the distance and position of other objects, but are still not inherently useful in their meaning. 
        - One might argue that they do still in this case have meaning, perhaps as another layer of complexity on top of the Sign and House. To this I say that, in the beginnings of my exposure to the astrologoical world, many astrologers (especially ones who happen to also be fans of mythology) will add any and as many layers of complexity, especially if it makes it more fun or interesting to interperet, so long as it does not obviously contradict a majority of the other layers (though it can contradict some without issue).
